The subducting plate interface is often discussed as being made up of local asperities with differing frictional properties. Most commonly:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Rate-strengthening
	\item Rate-Weaking
	\item Conditionally stable 
\end{enumerate}
These properties govern the predominant slipping mechanism for that part of the subduction interface, either fast seismic slip or slow aseismic slip.

\end{center}\vspace{0.3cm}

Here we present some observations of geodetically observed slip behavior in Nicoya, and discuss this within the context of lifespan of segmented slip behaviors.

\section*{Pre-earthquake observations of slow slip}
\color{DarkSlateGray}
Prior to the 2012 M7.6 earthquake there are 6 large slow slip events with $Mw>6.5$ (SSEs). There were intermittent smaller events near our geodetic threshold irregularly in between which we deem inter-SSEs. These events are generally have both shallow ($depth<15k$) and deep ($depth > 35km$) slipping patches.

\end{center}\vspace{0.2cm}

\subsection*{Recurrence Rate}

Here we calculate the recurrence rate of the large SSE in Nicoya prior to the earthquake. Classifying the SSE into:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Large\textsuperscript{1} events  $Mw>6.5$
 \item Small\textsuperscript{2} events  $Mw<6.5$ 
\end{itemize} 

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em
\item Events in 2003, and 2005 considered took place when only a small number $<3$ stations were operating. However, observed displacements as well as bore hole pressure meters near the prism toe [Davis et al. 2006] indicate these were large events consistent with  in 2007 and 2009.
\item Small events are near detection threshold only found by comparing with tremor.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Slip Histories}

Here we describe the spatial and temporal evolution of slip for the pre-earthquake slow slip events. 
\subsection*{Method}
\begin{itemize}
\item Remove seasonal signals, gps offsets, and secular rates.
\item Employ modified version of the Network Inversion Filter.
\item Maximum likelihood approach in order to solve for  fault slip and noise components. 
\item Middle American trench geometery from Kyriakopoulos, C., et al. "A new seismically constrained subduction interface model for Central America." Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 120.8 (2015): 5535-5548.

However, it has a considerable longer duration with slip ongoing for more than 6 months. }

\section*{Co-Seismic and After slip}
\color{DarkSlateGray}
On September 5th 2012, a Mw 7.6 nucleated just underneath the geodetic network. This is a characteristic earthquake for the region with a average 50 year recurrence interval. The event takes place between the previously identified patches experiencing SSEs.

\subsection*{Timing}

The 2014 event occurs 21 months, and the 2015 event occurs 20 months after the 2014 event. Consistent with large SSEs observed prior to the earthquake and appears unchanged. The 2015 event begins in October of 2015 but is not discussed here.

\section*{Conclusions}
\color{DarkSlateGray}
The dense geodetic network in Nicoya has allowed for observation of the interaction between aseismic and seismic slip phenomena. The behavior of the megathrust seems to be spatial varied and constant through out the earthquake cycle. Evidence includes:
\newline
\begin{enumerate}
\item A recurring seismic asperity that generates $Mw \approx 7.6$ earthquakes every 50 years .
\item Persistent SSEs occuring every 21 months of $Mw \approx 7.8$. The timing events are unaltered by large earthquakes.
\item Afterslip predominately bounded by slow slip regions. Although, a small amount of afterslip is required in both shallow SSE zone and withing coseismic rupture area. 
\end{enumerate}

This suggests that slip in Nicoya may be controlled by the physical properties of the down going slab and thus are long term stable.
